        <div class="achievement-text">
            <p>My wife and I got some extremely exciting news in the middle of last year: My wife was pregnant! With identical twin boys. This has completely thrown our plans out the window. We already have one beautiful 18-month-old daughter and these boys could come days after I graduate. We will have three children under two years of age.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our plans to buy a house in Dallas, TX went up in smoke. Twins are expensive. The most expensive purchase we had to make as a result was a bigger car to accommodate our growing family. Speaking of family, we could no longer uproot our lives to go live in a completely new place anymore; we had to be close to the support of our family.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So with less money in our bank account than ever and family from both sides living in only two states, Utah and Arizona, our options for where to work suddenly became more limited than ever. Our original goal was to move to Dallas, TX where I had good relationships with past colleagues at The Boeing Company in supply chain management. I interned at the Seattle, WA office over the summer and loved the company and could see a future working for them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My wife currently works for the BYU financial aid office as the Director of Scholarships and she loves her job. She would also feel fulfilled if she could keep working. When we had our daughter in my first month of the MBA program I realized that I wanted to do nothing more than raise this beautiful girl. Oh, how our dreams can change in an instant. Now my wife and I are talking about her going back to school to get a graduate degree through BYU while I am the stay-at-home parent with our three little ones. We’ll have to see once these boys come along.</p>
            <br>
            <p>BYU MBA students in my cohort have experienced an unprecedented drought in recruiting this year. Fewer students have received full-time offers this year than ever before. We’re not sure why, but it’s alarming. With this severe drought, I am probably going to take some time away from the job search to help my wife recover from labor and help with our little ones. After a couple of months of focusing on my family, I will put my nose to the grindstone again and try to find a job. So much has changed for us in so little time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My eventual hope, if my wife and I decide that she is going to be a stay-at-home mom while I work, is that I will find a job I love working for a manufacturing company in supply chain management. I especially love the aerospace industry. My hope is to work remotely until we can get by without the help of family, and then within the next five years move to Texas where we can establish our own roots and raise our children. In ten years I hope to have moved around and gotten enough experience that I can earn a wonderful salary and afford to take my family on trips from time to time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I especially love working in supplier relationship management. I enjoy purchasing goods from suppliers and working on deals. Ideally, I would find a position as an asset manager or purchaser where I could travel occasionally for work to buy materials. Eventually, I think I could be a project manager and lead teams on large-scale projects. I am a hard worker and believe I could make a difference in the world.</p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <div class="achievement-text">
            <p>I am a supply chain professional. After graduating with an undergraduate degree in Global Supply Chain Management from BYU in 2020 I went to work for a company called NorthStar Home, a home security company. I was a supply chain administrator and led a three-person team in all of the company’s inventory processes. I oversaw item returns and technician stock and worked to make the entire supply chain more efficient. </p>
            <br>
            <p>After almost two years working there, I was admitted into the BYU MBA program with an emphasis in supply chain and a STEM specialization. I also pursued two minors in international business and information systems as well as earned the Marriott School of Business’ prestigious Global Business Certificate. I speak Portuguese and would love to be able to use that skill in my work one day, so having an emphasis on global and international studies was extremely important to me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During my MBA I had opportunities to work and apply my skills. I had a summer internship working for The Boeing Company as a supplier management intern in their Seattle, WA office. Two of my biggest projects were working on an emergency project to secure over 200 critical parts for our aircraft and helping multiple teams that I worked with to automate their daily tasks. </p>
            <br>
            <p>For the entire second year of my MBA program, I consulted for Savage Global Consulting as a Savage Scholar. I began by consulting a call center company in the Philippines to help them implement the use of generative artificial intelligence in their business processes. I then became the team lead for a project consulting for a trailer manufacturer in Canada on how they could best expand their manufacturing operations into the United States.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have been honing my craft for years, and with my international experience and specialization in STEM, I am confident that my experience has prepared me for many of the challenges that lie ahead.</p>

            <p>These graphs show how much supply chains globally were disrupted by the effects of COVID-19. This is evidence that this is an extremely important sector that until the pandemic hadn’t much been in the spotlight. Companies had to adapt to the changes brought about by the pandemic, and if they couldn’t adapt then they suffered. I want to be part of the change that will prevent disruptions such as these moving forward.</p>

            <p>What will my contributions be?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <div class="achievement-text">
            <p>I know I can make a difference in the field of supply chain management. As I mentioned before, my background in international business and STEM management will make me an invaluable asset. I have already worked overseas in various countries and love to learn about and meet new peoples and cultures. But my skill set doesn’t stop at interpersonal relations; I have the hard skills necessary to get the job done.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I love people. I love working with people. I love helping people. I pride myself in my ability to listen and understand what people need and then take the necessary steps to execute whatever they need accomplished. This has helped me in many of my previous work situations in the past. I am also dependable. When I say I will do something I will do everything in my power to keep my word, and when I make a mistake I am accountable for my actions and take responsibility.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I love data. I love puzzles. I love problem-solving. I have been trained on many management software systems and coding languages and I love to take chaotic data and make it sing. I am a creator at heart and when I make a beautiful visualization that can tell a story, that is when I feel truly accomplished. And if it can direct my company to make a business or operational decision that will save hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, even better.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By combining my hard and soft skills I can make a difference in the world. I am confident that by sharing the love I have for peoples around the world and using the skills I have learned from years of work and study I can provide solutions to problems that people may not have yet considered. I can think outside the box and use my network and love of learning to encounter unique solutions to any business problem. I hope to be able to use these skills in a way that benefits as many people as possible.</p>
